# website
Collection of web-apps created by Harry Sarson, showcasing use of the [html5 ``` <canvas>``` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) to create interactive animations, including a pong game and a curve fitter.

The project is written in es6 javascript, scss and html5 and uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to build the website, bundling, polyfilling and transpiling code.
